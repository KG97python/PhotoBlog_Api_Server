# Current Project
I used mySQL as database and Golang to organize, obtain and store all data into the database.
This platform allows users to upload images, statuses and message others. There is a feed in which
which you can view the statuses and images of others. You can also personalise your profile page as to how
you see fit. All of this data is real time and is constantly updated and maintained. I am Now finished with the Back-end,
and im currently working on the front-end design. Please feel free to view the code on my github and send me any feedback
you got!
